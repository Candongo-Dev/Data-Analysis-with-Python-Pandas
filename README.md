# Data Analysis with Python & Panda

Project Summary
This project aimed to analyze a dataset detailing data scientist salaries and roles. 
Using Python with the Pandas library, we performed data cleaning to ensure accurate analysis. 
We explored the dataset through statistical visualizations histograms, boxplots, and bar charts created with Matplotlib.

To enhance accessibility, we built an interactive dashboard using Streamlit, enabling users to filter data and generate graphs efficiently. 
Development was carried out in Visual Studio Code within a Python virtual environment (created via venv). 
The final dashboard was successfully deployed to Streamlit Cloud.
